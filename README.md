## Description

Google books search app built with MERN stack, the user is able to sign up and login. The user can search any book desired and save it to thier profile to keep track of favorites.

The goal of this assignment was to refactor the application from RESTful practices to be compatable with Apollo Server and GraphQL API. This assignment was very challenging trying to implement GraphQL and Apollo server in an already working application. The challenge lies in completely understanding the given code and changing of adding code while understanding the structure and how each file is connected in order to successfully refactor the code base without breaking any code and having a final result of an application with the same functionality but with different methods.
